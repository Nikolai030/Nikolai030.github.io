# Dustin Henderson

Personality... smart, goofy, and confident. Dustin gets picked on because he has cleidocranial
dysplasia, which causes him to lisp because his teeth and jaw are oddly shaped. 
But he doesn't let the bullies get to him. He's secure in who he is and that his friends
have his back, and that's what matters.
